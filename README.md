# SentimentAnalysis
A Project to analyse sentiments of reviews of Books. Using machine learning algorithms,
sentiment of new reviews can be classified as either Positive or Negative. Model learns the data that is given to it and
and generalise to the patterns.

Tech Stack -> Python, Numpy, Scikit-learn

It covers->

i. Loading of data and segmentation of data to equally variate both types of classification
ii. Vectorization of data to be made fit for use
iii. Application of different ML classification algorithms
iv. Evaluating the model with metrics
v. Tuning the parameters using GridSearchCV
vi. Saving the model for later use
